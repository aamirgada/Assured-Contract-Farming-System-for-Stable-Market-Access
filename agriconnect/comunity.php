  <h1>Community Support</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Farmers and Buyers Stay Connected</h2>
    <p>Our platform connects the farming community with the buyer community in a simple and helpful way. Farmers can share their crops and see market prices, while buyers can explore what's available and make purchases directly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Real-Time Market Awareness</h2>
    <p>Both farmers and buyers get access to updated price trends and crop demand. This helps in making better decisions â€” when to sell, what to grow, and where to buy from, based on actual market conditions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Trust and Transparency</h2>
    <p>Everyone in the community can see product availability, prices, and seller information clearly. This builds trust and ensures smoother transactions between farmers and buyers without confusion or middlemen.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Buy and Sell Made Easy</h2>
    <p>Using market analysis and price updates from our site, farmers know the right time to sell and buyers know when and where to buy. This keeps everything fair, fast, and simple for both sides.</p>
